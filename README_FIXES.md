## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Errors)
❌ mongoose.model.admin → Syntax error
❌ Rate limiter after routes → Not protecting endpoints
❌ Search using undefined `data` → Crash on search
❌ API endpoint mismatch → 404 errors

❌ Stops sent in multiple requests → Validation errors
❌ Delete without confirmation → Accidental deletions
❌ Token not properly verified → Security issues

### After (Fixed)
✅ Correct mongoose syntax → Models work
✅ Rate limiter before routes → Endpoints protected
✅ Search queries database → Search works perfectly
✅ Consistent API endpoints → All requests succeed
✅ Proper Authorization headers → Auth works everywhere
✅ Stops sent with bus → Single request, no errors
✅ Delete with confirmation → Safer UX
✅ Enhanced token verification → More secure
