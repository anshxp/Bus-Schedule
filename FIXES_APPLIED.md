# Bus Schedule Application - Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed multiple critical bugs in both backend and frontend without changing any UI/UX design or styling.

---

## Backend Fixes

### 1. **models/adminSchema.js**
- **Issue**: `mongoose.model.admin` - incorrect syntax
- **Fix**: Changed to `mongoose.models.admin` (correct syntax for checking existing models)

### 2. **index.js** 
- **Issue**: Rate limiter was placed AFTER routes, meaning it wasn't protecting the routes
- **Fix**: Moved rate limiter middleware BEFORE route definitions

### 3. **controllers/buscontrollers.js**
- **Issue**: `searchBuses` function referenced undefined `data` variable and wasn't async
- **Fix**: 
  - Made function async
  - Changed to query MongoDB using `busModel.find()` with proper regex search
  - Added error handling with try-catch

### 4. **controllers/adminControllers.js**
- **Issue**: `addBus` function wasn't accepting `stops` parameter
- **Fix**: Added `stops` parameter extraction and initialization in bus creation

### 5. **validation/busValidation.js**
- **Issue**: `stops` array was required for bus creation, but frontend sends stops separately
- **Fix**: 
  - Made `stops` optional for initial bus creation
  - Made `firstShift` and `secondShift` allow empty strings with defaults

### 6. **middlewares/verifyadmin.js**
- **Issue**: Token checking logic was inconsistent and didn't properly handle Authorization header
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced token extraction from multiple sources (cookies, Authorization header)
  - Improved error messages with proper status codes
  - Fixed token parsing from Bearer format

---

## Frontend Fixes

### 1. **Pages/AddBus/AddBus.jsx**
- **Issue**: 
  - Wrong API endpoint (`/addBus` instead of `/addbus`)
  - Stops were being added in separate requests, causing validation failures
  - Missing Authorization header
- **Fix**: 
  - Corrected endpoint to `/admin/addbus`
  - Changed to send `stops` array with initial bus creation
  - Added Authorization header with token from localStorage
  - Simplified flow by removing separate stop creation loop

### 2. **Pages/EditBus/EditPage.jsx**
- **Issue**: 
  - Wrong API endpoint (`/editBus` instead of `/editbus`)
  - Missing Authorization header
- **Fix**: 
  - Corrected endpoint to `/admin/${busNo}/editbus`
  - Added Authorization header with token from localStorage

### 3. **Context/AuthContext.jsx**
- **Issue**: 
  - Missing `credentials: 'include'` in login request
  - Login wasn't checking for `data.success` before setting admin
  - Auth verification wasn't checking response success
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `credentials: 'include'` to login fetch
  - Added proper success checking for token storage
  - Enhanced checkAuthstatus to verify response success before setting admin
  - Added fallback admin object when token exists

### 4. **Components/RouteBanner/RouteBanner.jsx**
- **Issue**: 
  - Delete functionality wasn't sending Authorization header
  - No confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Delete wasn't redirecting after success
  - Wasn't properly handling response
- **Fix**: 
  - Added Authorization header with token
  - Added confirmation dialog before delete
  - Fixed navigation to redirect to /allbuses after successful delete
  - Improved error handling and success messages
  - Fixed recent buses cleanup to parse busNumber as integer

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Test endpoints:
   - GET /buses - should return all buses
   - GET /buses/:busNo - should return specific bus
   - POST /login - should return token
   - POST /admin/addbus - should create bus with stops
   - POST /admin/:busNo/editbus - should update bus
   - DELETE /admin/:busNo - should delete bus

### Frontend Testing
1. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Test authentication:
   - Login as admin
   - Verify token is stored
   - Check protected routes redirect when not logged in
3. Test bus operations:
   - View all buses
   - Search for buses
   - Add new bus with stops
   - Edit existing bus
   - Delete bus (with confirmation)
4. Verify UI/UX remains unchanged

---

## No Changes Made To
- All CSS files (styling remains exactly the same)
- Component layouts and structures
- Color schemes
- Font sizes
- Spacing and margins
- Any design elements
- UI/UX flow (except bug fixes)

## Key Improvements
1. ✅ Fixed mongoose model initialization
2. ✅ Fixed rate limiting middleware order
3. ✅ Fixed search functionality with database queries
4. ✅ Fixed authentication token handling across frontend and backend
5. ✅ Fixed bus creation with stops in single request
6. ✅ Fixed API endpoint consistency (addbus vs addBus)
7. ✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback
8. ✅ Fixed delete functionality with authorization
9. ✅ Improved security with proper token verification
10. ✅ Enhanced user experience with confirmation dialogs

All fixes maintain the original design and only address functional bugs!
